# Math 511 Omicron Wave Modeling Project
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I performed multiple regressions on the Omicron wave of COVID hospitalization data using MATLAB. Using the different regressions, we were able to determine which disease model fit best. Models were derived from first principles using compartmental epidemiological analysis. Writeup generated using LaTeX.
