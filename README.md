# Math 510 Net Ecosystem Exchange Project
As a part of my mathematical modeling series (WWU Math 510-515), I completed a group project where we developed a model for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of several salt marshes in the Wanquiot Bay in Massachusetts. We were given data from researchers from West Virginia University, which tracked the NEE of the salt marshes along with 5 other variables. We derived the model using the Buckingham-pi theorem, which finds the relationships between variables by using the dimensional units of each quantity. After developing the model, we used R to calculate the parameters of the model. The final writeup was generated using LaTeX.
